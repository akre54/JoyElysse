              You’ve probably been there before. Breathlessly, inexplicably restless from night after night of thick heat pregnant with possibility. And then, swept up – without warning – into the swirl of a hyperreal romance that you know won’t last the summer. In her debut single “Eve,” Brooklyn-based  singer-songwriter Elysse recounts such a romance – the rapture along with the anguish – with lucid clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a five-and-a-half minute meditation on the heady rush of desire,“Eve” plays like a dream sequence, laced with tendrils of ethereal guitar and effects that curl seductively around Elysse’s diaphanous voice. Yet, while the lush vocals and sinuous groove may bear the sonic trappings of a slow jam, there are no clubs, no bedrooms, no champagne, no limos to speak of. Lyrically, Elysse draws instead upon on far older motifs of desire&elip;  and its discontents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think way back. To Milton. To Genesis. With “Eve,” Elysse explores what it means as a woman to be the object of desire, alluding to the self-reflexive Eve of Paradise Lost, but also embodying the forbidden fruit itself (“I’m the apple your eyes are dreaming of”). Despite her heady rush, she plagued the “Furies” of Hades, as, though it may be the “eve of a summer love,” she’s “coming to the Fall again.”
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s only natural that her songwriting should have a literary bent - for Elysse, that’s home base. A voracious reader from an early age, she entered Princeton University at the age of 15, where she majored in English, and further pursued her interests in the Classics and British literature. While there, she cut her teeth at literary criticism, but it wasn’t until her time as a graduate student at NYU that she discovered her passion for songwriting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The seeds, however, had been planted from her early childhood. While most 90s children were listening to the Backstreet Boys and TLC, her father, a jazz saxophonist, instilled in her a love for Antonio Carlos Jobim, Stevie Wonder, Sarah Vaughan, Laura Nyro, Dexter Gordon, Burt Bacharach, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. These are the sounds that formed her love of melodies and adventurous chord progressions, that informed her belief that the best songs serve as portals into new frontiers of feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by the diverse range of musicians she worked with in New York City post-NYU – she’s fronted psychedelic salsa band La Mecanica Popular, performed extensively as a jazz singer, and has served as a supporting vocalist for both progressive folk and alt-rock outfits– Elysse has come to carve out her own intertextual sensibility: a dreamlike yet potently visceral collage of sound that she describes as Neo-Surrealism.
            </p>
            <p>
              To realize “Eve,” Elysse enlisted the talents of co-producers Joe Harrison (Nick Hakim) and Rahm Silverglade (Kiah Victoria, Altopalo). As an ecclectic mashup of the vintage and the vanguard, “Eve” nods to the retro-futurism showcased in the work of Elysse’s contemporary influences, including Emily King, Janelle Monae, and Anderson Paak. However, Elysse has confidently put her own stamp on the sound; “Eve” heralds her forthcoming EP, due late Spring 2017.
